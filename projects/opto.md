For this project, myself and three other team members focused on developing an Android application from the ground up.
This Android application was a multi-player game based on the board game Khet. This included the Android application 
itself, a Springboot server, a MySQL database, and an administrator focused webpage. I specifically focused on 
developing the core game logic, as well as standardizing the communication between the Springboot server and the Android
application. This was my first major software assignment that had multiple parts to it. I learned of the value of 
ensuring that team members communicate and agree on what the interfaces of shared components should be. I also learned
how to make a simple interactive Android application, capable of persisting data across sessions through an outer MySQL 
server.

We also learned basic architectural diagrams within the course that this project was done in.
