title: 'Roomba Robot'
---
For this project, myself and three other team members worked to provide the programming for
an already setup Roomba. This Roomba had been outfitted with sonar, infrared sensors, a WiFi module, 
and the already builtin bump sensors. We had to develop the necessary programming to communicate with
the Roomba and navigate it through an obstacle course without being able to visually see the Roomba.
This project was based in C and taught me a number of things: how to build communication channels over WiFi,
how to setup registers for the Roomba in C, microprocessor programming, and how to communicate with physical
hardware directly.
